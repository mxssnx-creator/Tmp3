// Force rebuild: 2026-05-05T19:30:00 — Fixed staling/jumping stats (root cause: multiple counter writers):
//   1. app/api/cron/generate-indications/route.ts → Removed indications_count and strategies_count writes
//      • Cron was writing to progression hash counters, conflicting with realtime engine-manager writes
//      • Separated stage-specific counters (base/main/real/total) but removed canonical counter writes
//      Result: Cron now only tracks stage-specific variants, not aggregate counters
//   2. lib/trade-engine/config-set-processor.ts → Isolated prehistoric from realtime counters
//      • Changed from incrementing shared indications_count/strategies_count to prehistoric-specific keys
//      • Now writes to prehistoric_indications_total and prehistoric_strategies_total instead
//      Result: Prehistoric data load doesn't bleed into realtime counting
//   3. Consolidated counter sources:
//      • engine-manager is NOW the single authoritative source for indications_count and strategies_count
//      • config-set-processor writes to separate prehistoric namespace (reference only)
//      • cron/generate-indications writes to stage-specific keys (base/main/real) not canonical counter
//   Result: Stats no longer jump or stale - single source of truth per counter, no race conditions

    //     map below.
