 * ║          PROGRESSION LOCK — ONE-RUNNER-PER-CONNECTION GUARD          ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Purpose:                                                            ║
 * ║   • Guarantee that at most ONE TradeEngineManager instance is active ║
 * ║     for a given connectionId across the entire deployment (every     ║
 * ║     Node worker, every cold-started serverless function, every dev   ║
 * ║     reload). The in-process `startingEngines` Set in                ║
 * ║     `GlobalTradeEngineCoordinator` only prevents duplicates WITHIN   ║
 * ║     the same process — under multi-instance deployments two workers  ║
 * ║     can otherwise each launch their own progression and race on the  ║
 * ║     same progression counters.                                       ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║   • Stamp a monotonically-increasing EPOCH (epoch-ms) on every       ║
 * ║     successful acquisition. The epoch is written to the canonical    ║
 * ║     `progression:{id}` hash so downstream observers (dashboards,     ║
 * ║     log dialogs, stall watchdog) can detect when a generation flip   ║
 * ║     happened. Stale in-flight callbacks that complete after a        ║
 * ║     restart will see `epoch` advanced and silently drop their write. ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Redis schema:                                                       ║
 * ║   • Key:    engine_lock:{connectionId}                              ║
 * ║   • Value:  "{ownerToken}:{epoch}"                                   ║
 * ║   • TTL:    LOCK_TTL_SEC (60s by default). MUST be refreshed every   ║
 * ║             ~LOCK_TTL_SEC/3 by the lock owner; if the owner dies     ║
 * ║             without releasing the lock will expire and another       ║
 * ║             worker can take over within at most one TTL window.      ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Atomicity:                                                          ║
 * ║   • Acquire   → `SET key val NX EX ttl` — single command, atomic.    ║
 * ║   • Extend    → read value, compare to owner token, then `expire`.   ║
 * ║                 Small window race (~ms) but bounded by the cheap     ║
 * ║                 read-then-write semantics of our inline Redis        ║
 * ║                 client; worst case is a one-tick-late TTL refresh.   ║
 * ║   • Release   → read value, compare, then `del`. Same window. The    ║
 * ║                 TTL provides the fallback safety net.                ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Note on the inline Redis client (`lib/redis-db.ts`):                ║
 * ║   The local in-process client doesn't support `SCRIPT EVAL`, so      ║
 * ║   compare-and-swap is implemented in JS rather than Lua. This is     ║
 * ║   fine for the inline path — there's only one consumer. When wired  ║
 * ║   to a real Upstash/ioredis client at deploy time the same APIs     ║
 * ║   still work (the `set` options `{NX, EX}` are standard Redis); we   ║
 * ║   just lose one round-trip's worth of strict atomicity, which the    ║
 * ║   TTL safety net covers.                                             ║
