/**
 * Per-base-asset minimum order quantity (in base units), keyed by the
 * uppercased base ticker extracted from a CCXT-style symbol.
 *
 * Used by:
 *   • app/api/test/live-orders-test/route.ts — test harness floors
 *   • lib/trade-engine/stages/live-stage.ts   — live SL/TP placement floor
 *
 * Single source of truth so the test and engine never drift apart.
 *
 * Values are conservative floors derived from BingX/Bybit/Binance
 * public exchangeInfo for USDT-perp pairs. They are NOT meant to be
 * authoritative — the connector should ideally call `/exchangeInfo`
 * at boot and cache the real values per venue — but as a static floor
 * they reliably prevent code=110422 ("minimum size per order")
 * rejections both in the test harness and live engine.
 *
 * The default for unknown symbols is 1 base unit, which is restrictive
 * enough to surface coverage gaps as the operator adds new pairs (a
 * sub-1-unit position will be force-floored to 1 — visible in logs —
 * rather than silently rejected by the venue).
